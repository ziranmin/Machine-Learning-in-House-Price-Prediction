# Macine-Learning-in-House-Price-Prediction
Summary:\
• Implemented machine learning models to predict sale prices of houses in Ames, Iowa given data in 5 years (2900+
observations and 70+ features) from Kaggle in Python Jupyter Notebook
• Conducted EDA to detect potential key features, skewness, outliers, and multicollinearity by Seaborn and Matplotlib
• Performed feature engineering through filling missing values, label encoding, and log transformation by Numpy,
Pandas, and Scipy, and ended with 200 + features
• Trained regression models by Sklearn and XGBoost, selected best single models as Ridge Regression and XGBoost
Regression by 4-fold cross-validation, and improved RMSE by 7% by model stacking
